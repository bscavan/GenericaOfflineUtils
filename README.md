# CharacterPage

This is an open-source project for creating a user-interface that allows players of Generica Offline to easily and consistently create and track their characters. Generica Offline is wholly owned by Andrew Seiple (and not at all by me). All work on this project is done with his permission, under the explicit conditions that it is not used to profit off of his intellectual property and that all credit for his intellectual property remains ascribed to him.

## Background

The game of Generica Offline is set in the same universe as Andrew Seiple's _Threadbare_ and _Small Medium_ novel series, which are delightful LitRPG works worthy of consumption. After completing his first set of novels set in this world (_Threadbare_), Mr. Seiple kindly released the alpha rules to the public free of charge. The aim of this project is to streamline the creation of characters for this game, automating the tracking of core attributes, defenses, and pools, so that players and game masters can focus on tracking their job classes and levels.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.
